    subtitle: <h4></h4>,
    caption: <p>Today, change to your virtual and physical environments is a function of business, happening fast and in high volumes. Oasis Discovery is designed to keep up with today’s hybrid IT, regardless of the location of the assets and in spite of increasing rates in change volume and change types. Auto-discovery is crucial to your business because it is impossible to stay up to date with this tremendous volume of devices, applications and cloud resources without the help of a powerful tool.<br/><br/>Two of the most important components of an IT Operations Management Platform are discovering all of your logical, physical and virtual assets and automatically maintaining an accurate CMDB. Additionally, the CMDB demands knowing how each element is related to the business; there must always be context and no element or Configuration Item (CI) can be an island unto itself.
    <br/><br/>The Oasis discovery engine is completely agentless, lightning fast, lightweight, and requires minimal credentials and IP addresses to do its work. The output of the Oasis Discovery engine drives the Oasis Analytics, Reporting and Automation Components. All assets and any changes are updated in near real-time.
    <br/><br/>Discovery methods that are leveraged in Oasis include: ICMP, Netbios, SMB, SNMP, JMX, WinRM, SSH and credentials to inspect virtual environments, cloud-based resources in Azure, AWS, Google and containers with management layers such as Kubernetes. Application relationships can be discovered passively through a combination of SNMP, SSH, WinRM and Netflow: depending on your own policies for polling.</p>

    img: 'images/appmonitoringmodal.jpg',
    subtitle: <p>Oasis, based on how it is configured, can monitor virtually anything and everything. Since the Oasis platform was designed to do end-to-end service management without the complexity of multiple tools, it is not dependent on other products to complete the solution’s monitoring capabilities. It is important to note, however, that there are numerous products that work well in tandem with Oasis; that flexibility allows us to integrate with your existing ITOM tools, home grown monitoring, element managers and performance management solutions.<br/><br/>
    <ul>
      <li>Measure end-user-experience and application performance via synthetic checks</li>
      <li>Network analysis of traffic to monitor production traffic</li>

    img: 'images/analyticsmodal.jpg',
    subtitle: <h4>Oasis delivers business impacting information straight out of your raw data.</h4>,
    caption: <p>Countless feeds from your devices, applications, logs and events are consumed by the Oasis ingestion engine, then normalized to generate context. In turn, that information can be converted into actionable intelligence by the Oasis analytics engine.<br/><br/>
              <ul>
                <li>Find anomalies based on classifying disparate data sources</li>
                <li>Easily forecast capacity challenges</li>
                <li>Watch for deviations in time-series data so you can focus on the events that most impact your business</li>

    altText: 'Oasis Event Manager',

    img: 'images/eventmanager-modal.png',
    subtitle: <h4>Reduce Noise with The Oasis Event Manager</h4>,
    caption: <p>The Oasis Event Manager (OEM) delivers a mature and modernized approach to Operations Management by
              reducing the noise in your system. Go from thousands of daily events down to a manageable volume for your
              NOC staff - a sure way to increase productivity. With OEM, they're able to pinpoint the root cause of business
              impacting events such as outages and performance degradations, quicker. <br/><br/>

              Events are automatically correlated to the services they impact so your operations team can prioritize
              troubleshooting. Additionally, Oasis Analytics proactively finds at-risk applications and devices, then alerts to
              their deterioration and heightened risk to the business. The synthetic Application Assurance tool constantly
              checks real world transactions for response time and availability. Systems are confirmed for both availability
              and reachability. For example, Oasis knows that a service may be unavailable because the NAS is unreachable
              due to a faulty switch. But the NAS is working properly and the appropriate team is dispatched to repair the
              switch. <br/><br/>
              The Oasis Event Manager is viewed through a single dashboard view and organized in a built-in view or by
              readily customizable templates. This flexibility matches the way your personnel work today so productivity is
              immediate and resolution times are reduced. The Oasis Dashboards are all convertible to Reports which can be
              scheduled, mailed or published to any portal. Key information is generated out-of-the-box, such as the Top
              Devices with Events and the Top Events generated. When maintenance windows are implemented, Oasis knows
              how to calibrate for Availability and Performance metrics and keeps alerts from being generated to the
              Helpdesk. Save your staff time and headaches.</p>
