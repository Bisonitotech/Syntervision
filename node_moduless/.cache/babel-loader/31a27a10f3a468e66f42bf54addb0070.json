Oasis Discovery is designed to keep up with today’s hybrid IT, regardless of the location of the assets and in spite of increasing rates in change volume and change types. Auto-discovery is crucial to your business because it is impossible to stay up to date with this tremendous volume of devices, applications and cloud resources without the help of a powerful tool.<br/><br/>Two of the most important components of an IT Operations Management Platform are discovering all of your logical, physical and virtual assets and automatically maintaining an accurate CMDB. Additionally, the CMDB demands knowing how each element is related to the business; there must always be context and no element or Configuration Item (CI) can be an island unto itself.\n    <br/><br/>The Oasis discovery engine is completely agentless, lightning fast, lightweight, and requires minimal credentials and IP addresses to do its work. The output of the Oasis Discovery engine drives the Oasis Analytics, Reporting and Automation Components. All assets and any changes are updated in near real-time.\n    <br/><br/>Discovery methods that are leveraged in Oasis include: ICMP, Netbios, SMB, SNMP, JMX, WinRM, SSH and credentials to inspect virtual environments, cloud-based resources in Azure, AWS, Google and containers with management layers such as Kubernetes. Application relationships can be discovered passively through a combination of SNMP, SSH, WinRM and Netflow: depending on your own policies for polling.</p>\n  },\n  {\n    id: 3,\n    altText: 'Oasis Application & Infrastructure Monitoring',\n\n    img: 'images/device.png',\n    subtitle: 'Reduce Noise with The Oasis Event Manager',\n    caption: <p>The Oasis Event Manager (OEM) delivers a mature and modernized approach to Operations Management by\n              reducing the noise in your system.
