                        <p className="section-subtitle text-muted text-justify padding-t-30 font-secondary">In 1994, we started a business called E&D Software Consultants. It quickly evolved from supporting small businesses to providing engineering services and specifically, implementing management solutions for large enterprises. This evolution brought many lessons. We found there was no reliable, unified data solution on the market. Our customers almost always required custom development solutions to reach their goals. With only piecemeal and expensive tools for us to use, our solutions were often too complex, lacked standards, and pushed out some medium and small businesses from benefitting. We wanted to change that, and so - Syntervision was founded in 2016 with plans for becoming a SaaS company.</p>
                        <p className="section-subtitle text-muted text-justify padding-t-30 font-secondary">We built our flagship product, the Oasis Platform, and made it align with ITIL processes that our customers could understand. Based on the challenges we encountered with the existing tool sets, we knew that having Discovery as a dynamic model to represent the environment we managed was crucial. We also knew that storing data in context of that model would then provide a structured unified data source in which we could build off of. We proved ourselves right, finding that the simplest way to manage large data was to structure it on ingest. Thinking big picture, we wanted our Oasis Platform software solution to be fully autonomous - which is where we find ourselves today. Syntervision is on a mission to create a fully cognitive software solution to digitally transform network service operations and security operations teams around the world; weâ€™d love to partner with you so we can get there together.</p>
